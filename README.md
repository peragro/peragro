About
-----
Peragro is more granular than your run-of-the-mill DMS, it tracks 'assets' within 'files' rather than just the 'files' themselfs. This allows for example to assign a task to a specific mesh with a Blender file, without the overhead of having to specify which mesh in the task's description.
